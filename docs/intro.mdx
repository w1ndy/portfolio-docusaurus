üëã Hi, I'm Di Weng (ÁøÅËçª), a tenure-track assistant professor at School of Software Technology, Zhejiang University.
My research interest lies in **information visualization and visual analytics**, focusing on interactive data transformation and spatiotemporal data analysis.
I've published over 15 papers in prestigious computer science conferences and journals, including IEEE VIS, ACM CHI, IEEE TVCG, IEEE ITS, etc.
I've also served as program committee members for IEEE VIS 2023, ChinaVis 2022 and 2023, and CGI 2023, as well as reviewers for many journals and conferences.
I received my B.Eng. degree from Shandong University in 2016 and Ph.D. degree from Zhejiang University in 2021.
